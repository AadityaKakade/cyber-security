                Cybersecurity Threat Detection using Machine Learning
In this project, I aimed to detect cybersecurity threats using machine learning. I used a dataset containing network traffic logs, system logs, and user activity logs to train and test several machine learning models. The best performing model was a Random Forest Classifier, which achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set.

I trained and tested several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. I evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The Random Forest Classifier outperformed all other models, achieving an accuracy of 95% on the test set.

Conclusion: Based on the results of my analysis, I recommend that the organization focus on implementing the Random Forest Classifier to detect cybersecurity threats. In future work, I plan to explore the use of deep learning models and natural language processing techniques to improve the accuracy of the threat detection model.
